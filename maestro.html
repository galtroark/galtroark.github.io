    <h1>Maestro</h1>

      <p>
  The silence within the opera hall was deafening. The darkness sat even more
prominent as the audience waited in the complete and total black.
They all knew who they would be witnessing today and while they were
mystified, the room was  silent as the audience waited in eerie stillness
and eager anticipation for what was to come. The whole scene gave the
feeling of a funeral, as the dead waited in their seats. Not a word
was uttered, not a breath was heard. The only light shone down from a lone
stage apparatus near the top of the hall, dust motes flowed across
the beam, they looked almost heavenly. The light swayed only slightly as
it pointed to the center of the stage. The beam pointed towards
the podium. In a matter of minutes, the maestro would appear on that
podium, surrounded in the darkness by his orchestra.
</p>
<p>
  As time passed in the silence and the darkness. The anticipation only
grew. The silence began to almost vibrate the room as people's
apprehensions increased. The maestro was known the world over for his
pieces. They were told to be the most powerful pieces of orchestral music
ever produced. Inhuman, something unimaginable until heard, they would
tear some to shreds and propel others to heights they could not
fathom. The maestro had an almost legendary presence amongst
humans. He was a musical genius, he was from out of this world and
his compositions reflected that cosmic and existential indifference
that one sometimes feels when staring out into the vast abyss of space.
</p>
<p>
  The silence in the room was shattered by a sudden resounding groan. Some
audience members shrieked and fell, others eyes opened wide. The groan
came from an organ hidden somewhere in the darkness of the stage, it
bounded across the inky blackness and penetrated the ears of all. It
vibrated the very seats they sat in and shook the audience to their
core. Then as soon as it had happened, the sound stopped. After a brief
second of fragile stillness like glass, lights along the edge of the
stage erupted and the maestro glided across his podium from the side
of the stage. He conveyed so much power, intensity and
wisdom. The audience didn’t even dare applaud, it was as if they were
in the presence of a god.
</p>
<p>
  The maestro didn’t glance at the audience as he entered, and when he
reached the podium he did not turn around to gaze at the audience his
musical prowess had gifted him. His eyes were beady, they were described
as eyes that could kill, he watched you as if he already knew
everything about you. They were dark brown, almost black. The maestro’s
hair was blacker than space, it slid about his head in a haphazard way
that suggested indifference. It coursed behind his ears and hung listlessly
in front of his eyes. His skin was pale and almost grey, but the maestro
was not unhealthy as his body was built like a predator. He wore his
tuxedo brilliantly, the jet black clothing being betrayed by the one
piece of colour he adorned, a blood red tie fixed tightly around his
tuxedo. Though no audience member could see it, as he walked his shadow
made a monstrous silhouette on the stage floor. The room waited for the
music to come, and the maestro obliged with a deft flick of his wrist.
</p>
<p>
  The stage lights turned on and the entire stage was immediately illuminated
in a golden light. The orchestral music began with a slow crescendo before
enveloping the enthralled audience in it's earth shattering awe. The
musicians bobbed back and forth as if in a hypnotic trance. The music
flitted around the opera hall with the passion of a fiery phoenix. Each
instrument flowed in perfect unison to create a turbulent tone
that sent audience members reeling. As they listened, the music only
seemed to be getting more beautiful. As the audience members
listened, the music gradually got louder. Some audience members began
to cry. A few screamed as they covered their ears, but their screams
were silenced by the deafening beat of the otherworldly
music. The rest of the audience began to tilt back and forth
to the same trance that the musicians seemed to be under.
</p>
<p>
  Around this point, the dressing rooms below the opera house were
being cleaned. A team of hardworking cleaners went through the oddly
dark dressing rooms one by one, clearing them of any leftover detritus. As
they worked across the long hallway, opening and clearing door after
door, they all began to smell a sickening stench. It was the
unmistakable smell of death.
</p>
<p>
  The maestro’s wrists and fingers delicately pulled the band like a puppet
as he conducted with tenacious control. The room vibrated around him as the
deep brass belted their low tones and the high flutes flitted their
impossible notes. While the opera hall was a dark place, the music almost
seemed to fill it with an even darker glow. As the maestro
danced with the orchestra, the volume and passion in the music only increased.
</p>
<p>
	The cleaners worked to the very end of the long hallway and frowned as
the smell got stronger. They gingerly opened the door of the very last
dressing room, the room in which the maestro had prepared for
tonight's show. The cleaners could hear the slightest echo of the
awe-inspiring music above them. The dressing room was inky in it’s
darkness, the sickly smell of death emanated from the
center of this darkness.
</p>
<p>
  On stage, the maestro lowered his hand and the orchestra lowered its
volume. A clarinet solo echoed out from the masses of silent
musicians. It threaded through the opera hall slowly, weaving through the
air and penetrating the very souls of the audience with it's
cool, tone-filled sound. The audience was still reeling from the first
auditory assault on their senses and only a few were able to watch as
the maestro began to raise his hand up again.
</p>
<p>
  One of the cleaners found the light and the dressing room was flooded
with a sickly orange hue. The cleaners became paralyzed. They were caught
in the whirlpool of a monstrous terror that they could not
understand. The large mirror within the room was shattered, The walls
had rips as if a colossal hound had been let loose. And laying in
the center of the room, surrounded in a puddle of his
own blood. The maestro himself lay dead, his pale eyes locked in
an expression of pure horror.
</p>
<p>
  The cleaners began to scream and yell. They had all seen
the maestro walk on to stage, so why was he dead in his dressing
room, and since he was. Who was conducting on stage?
</p>
<p>
  If one had listened closely, they would not have heard the cleaners
screaming for help below the stage. They would only hear the
deafening, otherworldly music of the maestro and his fallen orchestra.
