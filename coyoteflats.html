    <h1>Coyote Flats</h1>

<div class="legib">
<p>
  Few people have heard the story of coyote flats, that arid place
in the town of Snake, where the barrel cacti and the brittle bush
litter sparsely the dusty ground. The town of Snake is hard
to find, fading like a ghost into the clouds and
dust devils that frequent the area. For this
reason, visitors rarely come through the town. It does
not show up on any maps and its residents are far from
welcoming. The story of coyote flats however
begins with a visitor. A lonely and truly lost
traveller who stumbled into the town in search of
some respite and shade from the oppressive and venerable sun.
</p><p>
  As with all visitors to Snake, he was
hastily forwarded to coyote flats, the arid and dry plot of land
just left to the center of town. It was clear he
didn’t enjoy the towns generosity as he let
out a mournful moan at the sight of the flats. Coyote flats
is dry and empty, offering no shade and respite
from the heat, coyote flats can become a hell for its residents.
It is said the visitor begged to sleep somewhere else, it is believed
he attempted a discussion with mayor Belial, who, following Snake
procedure, banished the visitor back again to coyote flats.
</p><p>
  “Everything is okay as it is in Snake, visitors bring with them
their troubles.” The mayor recounted as the visitor was pushed
into the flats. He was rooted and trapped in shock; a colony of
ants took the opportunity to create a miniature silk road over the
dusty toe of his left boot.
</p><p>
  “There are no angels here, it is much too hot.” The visitor mumbled.
Some residents agreed and sauntered off. The few that remained
watched with rapt interest as the visitor stumbled drunkenly
farther into the flats, apologizing to God as he went. The residents
chuckled scornfully; they knew that no good man ever presented
himself in Snake. Nevertheless, as the dust devils arose and came towards
the visitor, they approached with hesitation. It is said that the
town went quiet then. A strange new wind whistled down main
street, it rattled the door at Moloch's bar, it swirled dust eddies
into baker Beelzebub’s oven, it swept right through into coyote
flats and dispersed the dust devils with
explosive force. What happened next is difficult to say. As everyone
knows, nobody leaves the town of Snake, much less Coyote Flats. In some
unexplainable divine way, the visitor left. Our depraved
visitor was picked up by this wind and lifted like a jutting mesa into
the cloudless sky, leaving behind nothing but the dust his prompt
exit had kicked up.
</p><p>
  Few people have heard the story of Coyote Flats, it’s a story
shamefully told. Only bad men arrive in the town of Snake, and
only bad visitors are sent to live in coyote flats. Since
forever this has been the rule. But this
despondent visitor, he who moaned for the shade, may not
have been a bad man. This fundamental question arouses fear
in even the oldest residents in Snake. The question that
maybe there could have been some kind of mistake.
